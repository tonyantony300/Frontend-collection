# Frontend-compilation
Where I Hone my frontend skills

## Motivation

A job is where we solve problems of the company. As months progress we think "I do the same the stuff every day, am I learning enough new things?" /n

Learning new things takes certain effort from our end but are we facing enough problems daily? /n

Its not easy to encounter things we don't know - problems. What are you doing intentionally to add problems into your life? /n

This is my humble attempt to add manageable frontend problems to my life so that I understand things i work on better.
