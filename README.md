Where I Hone my frontend skills

## Motivation

In our professional lives, our job entails solving the problems of the company. However, as time goes by, we may find ourselves pondering whether we are truly expanding our knowledge and skills. 

Learning new things requires a conscious effort on our part, but are we encountering a sufficient number of challenges on a daily basis? 

The reality is that it's not always easy to stumble upon unfamiliar problems. So, it's worth considering what deliberate steps we are taking to introduce challenges into our lives. 

With this in mind, I've embarked on a humble journey to incorporate manageable frontend problems into my daily routine. This endeavor aims to enhance my understanding of the tasks I work on and foster continuous learning and growth.
